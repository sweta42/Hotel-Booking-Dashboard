## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Booking Volume Peaks**: Bookings peak during the summer months, suggesting seasonal trends.
- **Dominant Market Segment**: The Online TA/TO (Travel Agents/Tour Operators) segment accounts for the majority of bookings.
- **Geographic Hotspots**: Guests from a few top countries dominate the customer base, providing opportunities for focused advertising.
- **High Cancellations**: A notable percentage of bookings are canceled — potentially due to no prepayment policies.

- **Segment Focus**: Offer tailored packages for the Online TA/TO segment since it contributes significantly to overall bookings.
- **Cancellation Policy Review**: Consider revisiting cancellation policies to reduce booking cancellations.
